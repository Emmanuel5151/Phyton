# Phyton

This is my first Python project titled "Frida Kahlo Exhibition". In this project I was asked to create a master list of each painting, its date, and its audio tour ID using my knowledge of python. I have attached my codes answering the questions. Check out my python repository.
Project was done on Jupyter platform
